Runtime-verification and testing of software rely on so called traces. These are snapshots of the program state at certain points in time which document the software’s behaviour.

When the behaviour deviates from the programmer’s expectation, often inspection of a trace may reveal the cause. However, reading raw traces as a human being may be cumbersome depending on the amount of data. An adequate visualisation of the relevant parts is key for
efficient debugging. 
For a smooth experience, the visualisation should be embedded in the same IDE where the development takes place and allow to view code and its trace side-by-side.

## Features

- VSCODE Plugin
- Trigger extension from VS Code command palette
- Input as a tracce file produces graph as output
- selection and deselction of graph point is possible
- Hovering effect etc.

##Future Work:
- Synchornized Scrolling
- Dynamic Graph
